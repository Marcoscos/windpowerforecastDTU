# windpowerforecastDTU
The project´s work is based in the theory from the course taught at "02456 Deep Learning", at the Technical Unviersity of Denmark (DTU). The course is graded based on the work contained in this repo, a report presented in scientific literature format and a presentation through a poster, also included in the repo.

The project's aim is to forecast wind power 48-hours ahead and allow for optimal price selection for selling electricity. The end goal is to obtain the most accurate forecast for the wind farm´s wind power. From an academic point of view, we are interested in defining a benchmark of wind power forecasting with relatively simple CNN and LSTM models, and identify the best approach, Time Series or Regression-focused.

The project is divided into two notebookds, which correcspond to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA.ipynb), in which we explore the dataset,
